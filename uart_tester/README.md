* Description
This tool is used to send packet data to the ESP32 for it to transform with an algorithm.
It includes algorithm selection and data selection capabilities. To run properly,
you must configure it with the correct serial port, which will be of the form "COM5" for Windows
and "dev/tty/usb0" for Linux. Furthermore, the ESP32 must be running the UART_Tester program.
