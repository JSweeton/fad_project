ADC:
	The ADC will need to run at specified intervals, at least at a 10 kHz range to detect
	user's voice. This will be done using a timer interrupt: at specified timer interval,
	an interrupt will be called, telling the ADC to gather an input from the analog in and
	transfer it to a digital signal. This will hopefully only take up a fraction of the cpu
	time, allowing other tasks to handle this timer when it occurs
	
	Option: Since freeRTOS operates at 1ms intervals, we can set it up so that the max delay
	from the user's voice to the headphones is at most ~2ms. This will be imperceptible to the
	human ear
	
	TODO:
	Set an ESP32 timer to call an interrupt at 10kHz. At every interrupt or every X interrupts,
	give a semaphore to the ADC data handler to perform an operation on the data.
